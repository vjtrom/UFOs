# UFO Sightings Website

## Overview:

This week, students were introduced to JavaScript and D3, and deepened their understanding of HTML, Bootstrap, CSS and working with JSON files. These tools allow users to efficiently interact with web pages, and provide a means for delivering, viewing and filtering data. This week’s module incorporates key concepts and skills development including:
- Understanding the differences between JavaScript "standard" and JavaScript version ES6+.
- Developing knowledge regarding JavaScript syntax
- Building and deploying JavaScript functions, including converting functions to arrow functions
- Understanding and building for loops and forEach loops
- Developing an understanding of JavaScript key words, parameters and objects
- Building, populating, and filtering tables using JavaScript and HTML

Also in this week’s module, the UFOs simulation offers a real-world example where Dana, a web developer, creates a webpage that lists out in tabular form several UFO sightings. Dana also builds a table form with the ability to sort based on key parameters.


## Results: 

- Dana and users of the webpage can use the functionality to sort by five parameters in various combinations.

- For example, Dana could sort by date alone, looking at which locations (city and country) may have experienced a sighting on the same day. This might suggest key activity taking place at various points around the world at the same time.

- Another example is to sort the information by location, which might suggest frequent or recurring sightings at that location, suggesting some type of interest by extra-terrestrials.

- Yet another example is to filter the data by shape, which might suggest the same or different types of space craft being used by extra-terrestrials.

## Summary:  

- One of the drawbacks of the new design is that requires and exact match of data input. For example, the date format must exactly match the data in the data.js file. Typing in  01/10/2020 will not yield the same result as 1/10/22. One feature for improvement would be to correct for these minor differences in date format. 

- Another drawback of the new design is that it dynamically updates the table, but a user might want to see additional data before applying the filter. Reintroducing the filter button so the user can execute the filter application might be a better way to go.
